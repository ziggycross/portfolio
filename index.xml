      <description>Receiving support for mood disorders, anxiety, ADHD, and other mental health issues can be a daunting task. In BC, where 26% of residents donâ€™t have a family doctor, access to treatment is additionally hindered by a lack of pre-existing medical records and lengthy gaps between appointments.
Even after a first appointment with a general practitioner, BC patients face a median wait of 33.3 weeks before they begin receiving treatment. Given these limitations, the initial screening process - a short form, typically completed online - is a valuable tool for physicians who need to quickly identify and allocate appropriate treatments.</description>

      <description>Marshmallow Skirmish was a charming and family-friendly first-person shooter game I developed in 2015.

Collaborating with my classmates Austin Rule, who handled the concept art, and Brodie Anderson, who was responsible for the player and weapon models, we created an engaging game that captured the attention of both attendees and judges at the Young ICT Explorers competition.</description>

      <description>Over one weekend, we developed a web tool for anonymizing data. This was in response to one of the presented hackathon problems highlighting how anonymity is often a difficult-to-approach topic for researchers working with sensitive data.
Working with my team, I developed an algorithm for finding potentially identifying values and determining the best way to handle them.
Under the k-anonymity model, sensitive data can be handled in one of two ways:</description>
