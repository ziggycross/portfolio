      <description>Receiving support for mood disorders, anxiety, ADHD, and other mental health issues can be a daunting task. In BC, where 26% of residents donâ€™t have a family doctor, access to treatment is additionally hindered by a lack of pre-existing medical records and lengthy gaps between appointments.
Even after a first appointment with a general practitioner, BC patients face a median wait of 33.3 weeks before they begin receiving treatment. Given these limitations, the initial screening process - a short form, typically completed online - is a valuable tool for physicians who need to quickly identify and allocate appropriate treatments.</description>
